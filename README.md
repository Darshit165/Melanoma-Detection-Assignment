# Melanoma-CNN-Prediction
>This project employs a personalized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify melanoma within images depicting skin lesions, belonging to one of ten distinct classes. Utilizing the Gradio library, a web application has been developed to facilitate model predictions. The model demonstrates an accuracy rate of 87% in its predictions.

## General Information
Algorithms Used:
Convolutional Neural Network

Dataset Information:

The dataset comprises 2357 images depicting both malignant and benign oncological conditions, sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). These images have been categorized based on ISIC's classification system, with each subset containing an equal number of images, except for melanomas and moles, where melanoma images slightly outnumber those of moles.

The dataset includes the following conditions:
Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion



## Conclusions
As the model's accuracy improves, its loss decreases accordingly. In its final iteration, the model achieves an accuracy rate of 87% with a loss value of 0.3. It effectively identifies the lesion's class with high precision. Augmenting the dataset and addressing class imbalances significantly contributed to the enhancement of the model's accuracy.
